## Graphback-Runtime 

Autogenerated runtime layer for your schema.
Graphback runtime can provide out of the box resolver and database layer for your application
without writing any line of the code.

## Usage

To use runtime capabilities developers will need to create data provider.
Currently 2 data providers are supported:

 - KnexDBDataProvider
 - PgKnexDBDataProvider

Default data providers utilize knex.js library as it supports wider range of the databases out of the box
and provides great developer experience. 

Then developers can create runtime instance:

```ts
    const client = new Knex(...);
    const graphbackOptions = {...}
    const modelString = `type Test ...`
    
    // Create backend
    const backend = new GraphQLBackendCreator(modelString, graphbackOptions);
    const dbClientProvider = new PgKnexDBDataProvider(client);
    const runtime = await backend.createRuntime(dbClientProvider);
    console.log(runtime.schema,  runtime.resolvers)
```    


Check our example application: https://github.com/aerogear/graphback/tree/master/packages/graphback-runtime/example 

### Running example

- Start the database
```
docker-compose up -d
```

- create database
```
graphback db
```
- Start the server
```
npm start
```

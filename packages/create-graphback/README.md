## Motivation 

Provides a small command line utility that can be used to initialise a [Graphback](https://graphback.dev) project. Graphback helps you to kickstart your experience with any existing GraphQL implementation by generating backend and client side CRUD layer using your GraphQL data model.

**Documentation**: https://graphback.dev

**Repository**: https://github.com/aerogear/graphback/

## Usage
You can initialise a Graphback project by either of the following commands:

```bash
npx create-graphback my-project
```

```bash
npm init graphback my-project
```

The CLI will ask you to pick from one of a number of templates. Once chosen, the template will be downloaded to your computer.

Change into your project folder:

```bash
cd my-awesome-project
```

And follow the instructions in the `README.md` file to know how you can run the project.

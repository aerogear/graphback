## Usage with Generated Resolvers

`@graphback/codegen-resolvers` package generates a resolver layer that utilizes the CRUD layer generated by the runtime framework.
By default resolver layer will based on the `crudService` field attached to context.
Developers can use the helper function `createKnexRuntimeContext` that will build default context for resolver layer.

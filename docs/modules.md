## GraphQL Modules

GraphQL modules (https://graphql-modules.com) provide way to extract common functionalities and decorate existing templates and generated source code. For example authentication module will introduce new set of directives that can be used directly in the schema to authorize specific users and roles. 


> NOTE: Modules integration is currently in progress.

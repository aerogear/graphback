Subscriptions are divided into three groups of changes: **Create**, **Update** and **Delete**. 

- `new<Type>`: subscribe to the [**Create**](./mutations#create) mutation event.
- `updated<Type>`: subscribe to the [**Update**](./mutations#update) mutation event.
- `deleted<Type>`: subscribe to the [**Delete**](./mutations#delete) mutation event.

Graphback generates a subscription handler and filter input for each CRUD mutation field to let you subscribe to mutation events and receive real-time updates.

```graphql
""" @model """
type Note {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  likes: Int
}

// highlight-start
input NoteSubscriptionFilter {
  id: ID
  title: String
  likes: Int
}

type Subscription {
  newNote: Note!
  updatedNote: Note!
  deletedNote: Note!
}
// highlight-end
```

### Examples

Subscribing to a [`create`](./mutations#create) event on `Note`:

```graphql
newNote {
  id
  title
  likes
}
```

Subscribing to a [`update`](./mutations#update) event on `Note`:

```graphql
updatedNote {
  id
  title
  likes
}
```

Subscribing to a [`delete`](./mutations#delete) event on `Note`:

```graphql
deletedNote {
  id
  title
  likes
}
```

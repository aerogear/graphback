## Graphback CRUD Client plugin

Graphback client plugin allows users to generate client-side queries based on the model and CRUD settings.
Developers can embed generated queries into their client-side applications.
Generated queries are compatible with all major GraphQL plugins like Apollo and URQL.

## Installation

```
npm install @graphback/codegen-client
```

## Usage

Client-side queries can be consumed inside any application. 
When using any GraphQL Clients queries can be compiled and passed to the client methods. 
For example:

```ts
apolloClient.mutate(createUserQuery)
```

Plugin allows to create files in many formats to suit the needs of your application.
The client documents for graphql format are generated in a single file and this should be used by generators, like;
[GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/)
[Apollo Generator](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tooling#code-generation)

You can also generate the client documents in typescript for direct use if you are not using a generator

## Plugin Config

```ts
  /**
   * Output language that will be supported
   * Our plugin supports multiple languages for simplicity
   *
   * - ts - typescript file output (backwards compatibility)
   * - graphql - .graphql file
   */
  format: 'ts' | 'graphql'

  /**
   * Generate only fragments and skip query, mutation and subscription elements
   * This can be particularly useful when many custom complex queries are needed
   * but they still base on autogenerated fragments
   */
  fragmentOnly?: boolean

  /**
   * RelativePath for the output file created by generator
   */
  outputFile: string
```

Example plugin configuration in YAML: 
```yml
 plugins:
  graphback-client:
    format: 'graphql'
    outputFile: ./client/src/graphql/graphback.graphql
```

> Note: Plugin require `crud` configuration specified as part of the `graphback` extension 


## How it works

Graphback asks whether you want to generate client-side queries in the `graphback config` command. Answering 'yes' will setup client generator plugin in your config.

For a data model having
```
type Note {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  description: String!
}
```
running `graphback generate` will generate queries and mutations that are enabled in crud config section.

At the core of a CRUD API is the database that Graphback interacts with by providing a rich set of tools and APIs that help you get your database working with your GraphQL application in minutes.

Graphback has a [CRUD abstraction](../crud/overview) with a number of out-of-the-box implementations for [PostgreSQL](postgres.md), [MongoDB](mongodb.md) databases. [SQLite](sqlite.md) database is also partially supported and we do not recommend using it in production environment, however it is a good choice for testing or development purposes.

Additionally, Graphback integrates with [GraphQL Migrations](../graphql-migrations/intro.md) so that you can migrate your databases using your business models defined in the GraphQL schema. 

:::note
GraphQL Migrations only operates on relational databases e.g PostgreSQL and does not work with MongoDB as shown in the [compatibility](#compatibility) table below.

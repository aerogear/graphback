## Database Schema Migrations

To offer fully comprehensive getting started experience Graphback provides database migration capabilities.
Database migration will rely on your schema with additional annotations to create all database tables.
Migration can incrementally alter database structure as your schema evolves.

For more information please refer to [`knex migrations`](/docs/dbmigrations) documentation.

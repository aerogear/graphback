title: Migrating to GraphQL
---

Graphback helps with building GraphQL server from scratch including database and API,
but in real world developers often already have their data stored in the database or work 
with very complex RESTfull API that needs to be migrated. 

For this purpose Graphback will offer number of migration options that allow developers to 
migrate their data or REST API to GraphQL Schema with very little effort, while still giving developers 
chance to tweak schema and underlying data access layer. 

## Graphback supported migrations

- OpenAPI (RESTfull server migrations)
- Database migrations (WIP)

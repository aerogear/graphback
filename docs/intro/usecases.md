## How can I start using Graphback

Graphback can be used in many different ways, depending on your use case:

1. Use Graphback with Node.js GraphQL boilerplates by using graphql `graphback init`
2. Add Graphback to your existing project using `graphback config`
3. Initialize Graphback in your code without code generation

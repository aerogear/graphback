Graphback allows you to add GraphQL API without code generation. 
Schema and resolvers can be created when your application code is executed and used to create instance of Apollo or GraphQL-js server

## Adding runtime layer to your application

To use runtime capabilities developers will need to create data provider. 

Currently 2 data providers are supported:

- KnexDBDataProvider
- PgKnexDBDataProvider

Then developers can create runtime instance:

```ts
    const client = new Knex(...);
    const graphbackOptions = {...}
    const modelString = `type Test ...`
    // TODO change this to reflect actual interface
    // Create backend
    const backend = new GraphQLBackendCreator(modelString, graphbackOptions);
    const dbClientProvider = new PgKnexDBDataProvider(client);
    const runtime = await backend.createRuntime(dbClientProvider);
    console.log(runtime.schema,  runtime.resolvers)

```

See [`runtime example application`](https://github.com/aerogear/graphback/tree/master/examples/runtime-example)
for more information.

## Adding custom resolvers to runtime

Runtime layer will come with autogenerated schema that will also include custom resolvers provided in model.
Developers can append their custom resolvers to resolver array to extend runtime layer.

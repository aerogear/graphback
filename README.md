  <br/>
  Auto generate database structure, <br/>
  GraphQL Resolvers and Queries from GraphQL types ðŸš€
</p>

## Motivation

Graphback helps you to kickstart your experience with any existing GraphQL implementation
by generating a Node.js server using your data model.

## What it does

- Generates required queries and mutations automatically using proven GraphQL patterns
- Generates an unopiniated resolver layer
- Generates database DDL statements that can be used to store data (optional)

## Why use it

- Plain and most canonical GraphQL implementation. Generated resolvers will work with plain GraphQL solutions.

- Works out of the box with Apollo GraphQL and GraphQL JS

- Full freedom - generated resources can be edited and reconfigured later

- Custom directives out of the box. Provides a set of useful directives and input types that resolve standard use cases

- Auto generated schema based on best GraphQL patterns

- Pick your own server framework and clients (works with Apollo Express and Hapi)

- Pick your own database. The solution abstracts from database storage and allows you to support any existing storage, by
implementing available interfaces.

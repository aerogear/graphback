Subscriptions are divided into three groups of changes: **Create**, **Update** and **Delete**. 

- `new<Type>`: subscribe to the [**Create**](./mutations#create) mutation event.
- `updated<Type>`: subscribe to the [**Update**](./mutations#update) mutation event.
- `deleted<Type>`: subscribe to the [**Delete**](./mutations#delete) mutation event.

Graphback generates a subscription handler and filter input for each CRUD mutation field to let you subscribe to mutation events and receive real-time updates.

```graphql
""" @model """
type Note {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  likes: Int
}

// highlight-start
input NoteSubscriptionFilter {
  id: ID
  title: String
  likes: Int
}

type Subscription {
  newNote(filter: NoteSubscriptionFilter): Note!
  updatedNote(filter: NoteSubscriptionFilter): Note!
  deletedNote(filter: NoteSubscriptionFilter): Note!
}
// highlight-end
```

### Examples

Subscribing to a [`create`](./mutations#create) event on `Note`:

```graphql
subscription {
  newNote {
    id
    title
    likes
  }
}
```

You can apply field-equality filters to the subscription:

```graphql
subscription {
  newNote(filter: {likes: 100}) {
    id
    title
    likes
  }
}
```

Subscribing to a [`update`](./mutations#update) event on `Note`:

```graphql
subscription {
  updatedNote {
    id
    title
    likes
  }
}
```

You can apply field-equality filters to the subscription:

```graphql
subscription {
  updatedNote(filter: {likes: 100}) {
    id
    title
    likes
  }
}
```

Subscribing to a [`delete`](./mutations#delete) event on `Note`:

```graphql
subscription {
  deletedNote {
    id
    title
    likes
  }
}
```

You can apply field-equality filters to the subscription:

```graphql
subscription {
  updatedNote(filter: {likes: 100}) {
    id
    title
    likes
  }
}
```

title: Migrating to GraphQL
id: migrations
---

Graphback helps with building a GraphQL server from scratch including the database and API,
but in real world developers often already have their data stored in the database or work 
with a very complex RESTful API that needs to be migrated. 

For this purpose Graphback will offer a number of migration options that allow developers to 
migrate their data or REST API to a GraphQL Schema with very little effort, while still giving developers 
the chance to adjust the schema and underlying data access layer. 

## Graphback supported migrations

- OpenAPI (RESTful server migrations)
- Database migrations (WIP)

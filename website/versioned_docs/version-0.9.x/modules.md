## GraphQL Modules

GraphQL modules (https://graphql-modules.com) provide a way to extract common functionalities and decorate existing templates and generated source code. For example, authentication module will introduce a new set of directives that can be used directly in the schema to authorize specific users and roles. 


> NOTE: Modules integration is currently in progress.
